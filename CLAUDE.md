5. Use consistent naming: mydocs-mcp-[diagram-type]-[date].drawio
```

#### **Development Specialist Workflow:**
```
WHEN starting MCP server development:
1. Use mcp-server-architect for server foundation and protocol implementation
2. Focus on MCP protocol compliance and transport layer setup
3. Establish tool registry system and server lifecycle management
4. Coordinate with other agents through clean interface contracts

```

#### **Agent Collaboration Patterns:**
```
CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES (must complete in order):
1. mcp-server-architect ‚Üí (foundation for all other development)
2. storage-engineer ‚Üí (required for tools and search)
3. tools-developer + search-engineer ‚Üí (can work in parallel)
4. testing-specialist ‚Üí (validates all components)

PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- tools-developer + search-engineer (both use storage interfaces)
- All agents can work with testing-specialist for continuous testing
- project-documentor can update documentation as development progresses
```

## üö¶ **CHANGE MANAGEMENT RULES**

### **Rule 1: ALWAYS Check Scope First**
```
BEFORE making ANY change:
1. Read docs/project-management/PROJECT_SCOPE_3DAY.md 
2. Verify change aligns with IN SCOPE items
3. If change affects OUT OF SCOPE items ‚Üí STOP and request approval
```

### **Rule 2: Document Changes Immediately**
```
EVERY medium/high impact change must be documented using individual change files:

FOR MEDIUM/HIGH IMPACT CHANGES:
1. Copy docs/templates/INDIVIDUAL_CHANGE_TEMPLATE.md
2. Create: docs/project-management/changes/CHANGE-XXX-[brief-description].md
3. Fill in comprehensive change details using template
4. Update docs/project-management/CHANGES_INDEX.md with new entry

FOR LOW IMPACT CHANGES (code tweaks, minor updates):
- Log directly in docs/project-management/CHANGES_INDEX.md summary
- No individual change file required
```

### **Rule 3: Scope Changes Require Approval**
```
IF change affects:
- Timeline (extends beyond 72 hours)
- Core deliverables
- Success criteria
- IN/OUT OF SCOPE boundaries

THEN:
1. Create formal change request using docs/templates/CHANGE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
2. Create individual change file with status "PENDING APPROVAL"
3. Update docs/project-management/CHANGES_INDEX.md with pending change entry
4. Do NOT implement until approved
```

```
WHEN calling project-documentor:
1. Summarize current project status
2. Specify exact documentation need
3. Reference relevant existing documents
4. Clarify timeline and scope constraints
5. Ensure agent has access to docs/ folder structure

WHEN using draw.io MCP:
1. **ANALYSIS PHASE** - Review and plan what needs to be drawn:
   a. Analyze current project context and documentation gaps
   b. Identify specific components, relationships, or processes to visualize
   c. Determine which diagram type(s) would be most effective
   d. List key elements that must be included in the diagram
   e. Consider target audience (technical/non-technical stakeholders)
2. **PLANNING PHASE** - Create diagram specification:
   a. Define diagram scope and boundaries
   b. List all components/elements to include
   c. Identify relationships and connections to show
   d. Plan diagram layout and organization
3. **CREATION PHASE** - Use draw.io MCP to create diagram:
   a. Reference existing system design context
   b. Create both source (.drawio) and export (.png/.svg) files
   c. Save in docs/diagrams/ folder with proper naming
4. **INTEGRATION PHASE** - Connect diagram to documentation:
   a. Reference diagram in relevant documentation
   b. Add explanatory text connecting diagram to project context
   c. Update CHANGES_INDEX.md with diagram creation summary or create individual change file if significant
```

## üìû **ESCALATION PROTOCOL**

### **When to Stop and Ask for Help:**
1. üö® **Immediate Stop Scenarios**:
   - Change would extend timeline beyond 3 days
   - Change requires OUT OF SCOPE features
   - Change affects core deliverables
   - Technical blocker prevents scope completion

2. üîÑ **Continue with Caution**:
   - Technical implementation choices
   - Code organization decisions  
   - Library selection within constraints

3. ‚úÖ **Proceed Freely**:
   - Code refactoring and optimization
   - Documentation improvements (use project-documentor agent)
   - Bug fixes and quality improvements

---

**Remember: When in doubt about scope impact, ASK FOR CLARIFICATION rather than assume. It's better to request approval for unnecessary changes than to violate scope accidentally.**
