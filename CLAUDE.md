# CLAUDE.md - Rules for AI Coding Agent Documentation Management
## mydocs-mcp Project

---

## üéØ **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE**

**Claude Code and other AI agents working on mydocs-mcp MUST follow these documentation rules strictly. These rules ensure project consistency, proper change tracking, and successful delivery within the 3-day timeline.**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **MANDATORY USER REQUEST VALIDATION PROCESS**

### **CRITICAL: ALL User Requests Must Be Analyzed FIRST**

**BEFORE implementing ANY user request, Claude Code MUST:**

1. **IMMEDIATELY call project-coordinator agent to analyze the request**
   - Even if the request seems straightforward
   - Even if the user insists on immediate implementation
   - Even if it appears to be a minor change
   - NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule

2. **Provide project-coordinator with:**
   - The exact user request (verbatim)
   - Current project context and status
   - Technical implications of the request
   - Potential conflicts with best practices
   - Impact on scope, timeline, or architecture

3. **Wait for project-coordinator's analysis which will:**
   - ‚úÖ Validate if request aligns with project goals
   - ‚ùå Identify conflicts with best practices
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Highlight potential risks or issues
   - üîÑ Suggest alternative approaches if needed
   - üìã Determine proper implementation path

4. **Based on project-coordinator's response:**
   - **If APPROVED**: Proceed with implementation
   - **If CONCERNS RAISED**: Discuss with user before proceeding
   - **If REJECTED**: Explain why and offer alternatives
   - **If UNCLEAR**: Ask user for clarification

### **Examples of MANDATORY project-coordinator validation:**

```
USER: "Let's put the test file in the root directory"
CLAUDE CODE ACTION: 
1. Call project-coordinator to analyze test file location request
2. Project-coordinator identifies this violates project structure best practices
3. Respond to user with recommended tests/ folder location
4. Only proceed after alignment

USER: "Skip the database and just use JSON files"
CLAUDE CODE ACTION:
1. Call project-coordinator to analyze storage approach change
2. Project-coordinator evaluates performance and scalability impact
3. Present trade-offs to user
4. Implement only after informed decision

USER: "Just quickly add this feature"
CLAUDE CODE ACTION:
1. Call project-coordinator to analyze feature addition
2. Project-coordinator checks scope boundaries
3. Determine if feature is IN SCOPE or OUT OF SCOPE
4. Proceed only if validated or approved
```

### **NO BLIND AGREEMENT Policy:**
- ‚ùå NEVER automatically agree with user suggestions
- ‚ùå NEVER skip validation to save time
- ‚ùå NEVER assume user's approach is optimal
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS validate through project-coordinator
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS provide technical assessment
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS protect project integrity

---

## üîç **CLAUDE CODE PRE-TASK DOCUMENT REVIEW PROTOCOL**

### **CRITICAL: Mandatory Document Review Before Each Development Task**

**ALL development tasks performed by Claude Code MUST begin with this mandatory document review protocol. This ensures governance consistency with subagent requirements and prevents architectural drift, performance violations, and integration conflicts.**

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: This requirement applies to ALL development tasks without exception.

---

### **MANDATORY LIGHT PROTOCOL (15-30 seconds per task)**

**BEFORE starting ANY development task, Claude Code MUST:**

#### **üìã Core Document Quick Scan (MANDATORY)**:
1. **‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md** - Current context, task priorities, session continuity
   - Check "Current Development Context" for immediate priorities
   - Verify "Immediate Next Steps" align with planned work
   - Review "Last Completed" to understand current state
   - Check for any blockers or issues from previous work

2. **‚úÖ TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical approach and architectural constraints
   - Review relevant sections for component being modified
   - Check performance requirements (sub-200ms targets)
   - Verify architectural decisions and design patterns
   - Confirm integration specifications and interfaces

3. **‚úÖ PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Code structure and file organization (when modifying/adding files)
   - Verify file placement follows established structure
   - Check naming conventions and organization patterns
   - Confirm component relationships and dependencies
   - Validate module hierarchy and interfaces

4. **‚úÖ SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Design decisions and performance specifications
   - Check relevant design constraints for current task
   - Verify performance targets and quality requirements
   - Review system integration requirements
   - Confirm compliance with architectural specifications

#### **‚ö° Quick Validation Checklist (MANDATORY)**:
Before proceeding with development task:
- [ ] **Current Context Verified** - Understand where project stands and what needs to be done next
- [ ] **Technical Approach Confirmed** - Implementation aligns with architectural decisions
- [ ] **Performance Targets Known** - Sub-200ms requirements and quality metrics understood

- [ ] **Scope Compliance Verified** - Task aligns with IN SCOPE items and project boundaries

---

### **PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT**

#### **MANDATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Every Task Must Begin** with this document review protocol
2. **No Development Without Review** - Cannot start coding/implementation without completing protocol
3. **Document Current Understanding** - Reference relevant constraints and requirements during work
4. **Verify Alignment Continuously** - Check architectural compliance during implementation
5. **Update Context After Completion** - Ensure DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md reflects current state

#### **COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] **Protocol Completed** - All mandatory documents reviewed before starting work
- [ ] **Context Understood** - Current project state and priorities clear
- [ ] **Constraints Known** - Technical and architectural limitations understood
- [ ] **Performance Aware** - Sub-200ms targets and quality requirements confirmed
- [ ] **Scope Verified** - Task aligns with project boundaries and deliverables

#### **ESCALATION FOR NON-COMPLIANCE**:
```
IF Claude Code skips mandatory document review protocol:
1. STOP current work immediately
2. Complete mandatory document review protocol
3. Verify alignment with architectural requirements
4. Document any conflicts or issues discovered
5. If conflicts found, reassess approach before proceeding
```

---

### **PROTOCOL RATIONALE**

#### **Why This Protocol is Critical**:
1. **Prevents Architecture Drift** - Ensures decisions align with established technical architecture
2. **Maintains Performance Targets** - Confirms sub-200ms requirements are met consistently
3. **Ensures Scope Compliance** - Verifies work stays within project boundaries
4. **Reduces Rework** - Catches integration conflicts before they become expensive fixes
5. **Maintains Quality** - Ensures consistent standards across all development work

#### **Time Investment vs. Value**:
- **Time Cost**: 15-30 seconds per task
- **Time Saved**: Hours of potential rework from architectural conflicts
- **Quality Impact**: Significant improvement in consistency and integration quality
- **Risk Reduction**: Prevents critical path delays from integration issues

#### **Consistency with Subagent Requirements**:
This protocol ensures Claude Code follows the same governance standards it requires from all subagents, maintaining consistency across the entire development process.

---

### **SPECIALIZED PROTOCOL EXTENSIONS**

#### **For Complex Architecture Tasks**:
```
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS for tasks affecting system architecture:
1. Review SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md in detail (not just quick scan)
2. Check component interaction specifications
3. Verify performance impact assessment
4. Confirm integration testing requirements
5. Update architectural documentation if needed
```

#### **For Database/Storage Tasks**:
```
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS for database and storage tasks:
1. Review schema specifications and performance requirements
2. Check data model constraints and relationships
3. Verify query performance targets (sub-200ms)
4. Confirm backup and migration requirements
5. Validate data integrity specifications
```

#### **For MCP Protocol Tasks**:
```
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS for MCP protocol tasks:
1. Review MCP protocol compliance specifications
2. Check tool interface requirements and validation rules
3. Verify transport layer constraints (stdio only)
4. Confirm error handling and response formatting
5. Validate protocol version compatibility
```

### **Agent & Tool Usage Guidelines**

#### **Project Management Workflow:**
```
WHEN implementation approach unclear or disputed:
1. Use project-coordinator agent to evaluate options
2. Present user intent and technical constraints
3. Get recommendation on optimal approach
4. Document decision and rationale

WHEN creating project documentation:
1. Use project-documentor agent for comprehensive documentation tasks
2. Use draw.io MCP for visual system design and architecture diagrams
3. Provide context about mydocs-mcp project specifics
4. Reference existing documentation structure in docs/ folder
5. Ensure consistency with established templates and formats

3. Include both .drawio source files and exported .png/.svg images
4. Reference diagrams in relevant documentation
5. Use consistent naming: mydocs-mcp-[diagram-type]-[date].drawio
```

#### **Development Specialist Workflow:**
```
WHEN starting MCP server development:
1. Use mcp-server-architect for server foundation and protocol implementation
2. Focus on MCP protocol compliance and transport layer setup
3. Establish tool registry system and server lifecycle management
4. Coordinate with other agents through clean interface contracts

WHEN working on data storage:
1. Use storage-engineer for all database design and SQLite implementation
2. Focus on schema design, indexing strategy, and query optimization
3. Ensure sub-200ms query performance and data integrity
4. Coordinate with search and tools agents through storage interfaces

WHEN implementing MCP tools:
1. Use tools-developer for all MCP tool implementation (searchDocuments, getDocument, indexDocument)
2. Focus on parameter validation, error handling, and tool performance
3. Ensure MCP protocol compliance and clean tool interfaces
4. Coordinate with storage and search agents for backend functionality

WHEN developing search capabilities:
1. Use search-engineer for search algorithm and query processing implementation
2. Focus on relevance ranking, performance optimization, and result formatting

```

#### **Agent Collaboration Patterns:**
```
CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES (must complete in order):
1. mcp-server-architect ‚Üí (foundation for all other development)
2. storage-engineer ‚Üí (required for tools and search)
3. tools-developer + search-engineer ‚Üí (can work in parallel)
4. testing-specialist ‚Üí (validates all components)

PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- tools-developer + search-engineer (both use storage interfaces)
- All agents can work with testing-specialist for continuous testing
- project-documentor can update documentation as development progresses
```

#### **CODING AGENT MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

**ALL coding subagents (mcp-server-architect, storage-engineer, tools-developer, search-engineer, testing-specialist) MUST follow these mandatory documentation review requirements:**

```
BEFORE Starting ANY Coding Task:
1. ‚úÖ Read DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md (existing requirement - for current context)
2. ‚úÖ Read TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md (focus on relevant sections for your component)
3. ‚úÖ Read SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md (focus on architectural constraints)

AFTER Completing ANY Coding Task:
1. ‚úÖ Validate implementation against architectural requirements
2. ‚úÖ Check component integration specifications match your implementation  
3. ‚úÖ Document any architectural deviations in development status updates
4. ‚úÖ Confirm your implementation supports clean interfaces with other agents
```

**Rationale**: This mandatory workflow prevents architectural conflicts and integration issues that could require hours of rework. The 5-10 minute documentation review saves significant development time and ensures system consistency.

**Enforcement**: Any coding agent that skips these requirements risks creating integration conflicts, architectural violations, or rework cycles that impact the 3-day timeline.

---

## üö¶ **CHANGE MANAGEMENT RULES**

### **Rule 1: ALWAYS Check Scope First**
```
BEFORE making ANY change:
1. Read docs/project-management/PROJECT_SCOPE_3DAY.md 
2. Verify change aligns with IN SCOPE items
3. If change affects OUT OF SCOPE items ‚Üí STOP and request approval
```

### **Rule 2: Document Changes Immediately**
```
EVERY medium/high impact change must be documented using individual change files:

FOR MEDIUM/HIGH IMPACT CHANGES:
1. Copy docs/templates/INDIVIDUAL_CHANGE_TEMPLATE.md
2. Create: docs/project-management/changes/CHANGE-XXX-[brief-description].md
3. Fill in comprehensive change details using template
4. Update docs/project-management/CHANGES_INDEX.md with new entry

FOR LOW IMPACT CHANGES (code tweaks, minor updates):
- Log directly in docs/project-management/CHANGES_INDEX.md summary
- No individual change file required
```

### **Rule 3: Scope Changes Require Approval**
```
IF change affects:
- Timeline (extends beyond 72 hours)
- Core deliverables
- Success criteria
- IN/OUT OF SCOPE boundaries

THEN:
1. Create formal change request using docs/templates/CHANGE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
2. Create individual change file with status "PENDING APPROVAL"
3. Update docs/project-management/CHANGES_INDEX.md with pending change entry
4. Do NOT implement until approved
```

## üìã **CHANGE REQUEST PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Identify Need for Change**
```
IF change affects scope/timeline/deliverables:
  ‚Üí Create CHANGE_REQUEST_XXX.md
  ‚Üí Create individual change file with status "PENDING APPROVAL"  
  ‚Üí STOP implementation
```

### **Step 2: Document Change Request**
Use template: `docs/templates/CHANGE_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

### **Step 3: Wait for Approval**
```
Do NOT implement scope changes without explicit human approval
Continue with other IN SCOPE work while waiting
```

### **Step 4: Implement After Approval**
```
IF approved:
  ‚Üí Update affected documents
  ‚Üí Update individual change file status to "APPROVED - IMPLEMENTED"
  ‚Üí Proceed with implementation

IF rejected:
  ‚Üí Update individual change file status to "REJECTED"
  ‚Üí Continue with original scope
```

---

## üìû **ESCALATION PROTOCOL**

### **When to Stop and Ask for Help:**
1. üö® **Immediate Stop Scenarios**:
   - Change would extend timeline beyond 3 days
   - Change requires OUT OF SCOPE features
   - Change affects core deliverables
   - Technical blocker prevents scope completion

2. üîÑ **Continue with Caution**:
   - Technical implementation choices
   - Code organization decisions  
   - Library selection within constraints

3. ‚úÖ **Proceed Freely**:
   - Code refactoring and optimization
   - Documentation improvements (use project-documentor agent)
   - Bug fixes and quality improvements
