---

## 📋 **Documentation Integration Requirements**

### **Diagram Standards**
- **Format**: Create both .drawio source and .png export for each diagram
- **Naming**: Follow convention `mydocs-mcp-[type]-2025-09-03.drawio`
- **Storage**: Save all diagrams in `docs/diagrams/` folder
- **References**: Include diagram references in relevant documentation

### **Documentation Updates Required**
After creating system design diagrams, update these documents:
- **docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**: Add diagram references to technical architecture
- **docs/PersonalDocAgent_MCP_PRD.md**: Reference architecture diagrams in technical specifications
- **README.md**: Include high-level architecture diagram for project overview

### **Change Management**
- Log all diagram creation in `docs/project-management/CHANGES.md`
- Ensure diagrams align with 3-day scope constraints
- Validate architecture supports MVP deliverables

## 🚀 **Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: Core Architecture (Day 1)**
1. **System Architecture Diagram** - Overall component relationships
2. **Component Relationship Diagram** - Detailed interactions
3. **Data Flow Diagram** - Document processing workflows

### **Phase 2: Integration Design (Day 2)**  
4. **MCP Protocol Communication Diagram** - Tool interactions and message flows

### **Phase 3: Deployment Design (Day 3)**

## 🔗 **Integration with Development Workflow**

### **Pre-Development Phase**

#### **ANALYSIS STEP - MANDATORY BEFORE DIAGRAM CREATION**
Before creating any diagram, Claude Code must:
1. **Review Current Context**: 
   - Read docs/project-management/PROJECT_SCOPE_3DAY.md (scope and deliverables)
   - Read docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md (technical architecture outline)
   - Review docs/PersonalDocAgent_MCP_PRD.md (system requirements)
2. **Analyze Documentation Gaps**:
   - Identify what concepts need visual clarification
   - Determine which components/relationships are unclear in text
   - Assess complexity level requiring visual representation
3. **Define Diagram Specifications**:
   - List specific components/elements to include
   - Identify relationships and data flows to show
   - Define diagram scope and boundaries
   - Determine target audience (technical vs. business stakeholders)
4. **Plan Diagram Layout**:
   - Organize components logically
   - Plan connection types and groupings
   - Consider information hierarchy and flow

#### **CREATION PHASE**
After thorough analysis and planning:
- Create all required system design diagrams using draw.io MCP
- Validate architecture against MVP requirements
- Update relevant documentation with diagram references
- Review diagrams with project stakeholders

### **During Development**
- **Before modifying diagrams**: Analyze what has changed and what needs visual update
- Reference diagrams during implementation
- Update diagrams if architecture changes (log in CHANGES.md)  
- Use diagrams for debugging and troubleshooting
- Validate implementation against design specifications

### **Post-Development**
- Update diagrams to reflect final implementation
- Create deployment diagrams showing actual configuration
- Document any deviations from original design
- Prepare diagrams for future development phases
