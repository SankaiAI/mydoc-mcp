# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-008  
**File Name**: CHANGE-008-coding-agent-document-requirements.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Time**: Pre-development Phase  
**Type**: Process/Tooling + Quality Enhancement  
**Impact**: Medium-High  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Add mandatory documentation review requirements for all coding subagents to prevent architectural conflicts and ensure consistency.

**Rationale**: Project-coordinator analysis identified high-value, low-risk improvement to prevent architectural conflicts and integration issues that could cost hours of rework. Minimal time investment (5-10 minutes) provides significant quality benefits.

---

## **Detailed Description**

This change implements mandatory documentation review requirements for all coding subagents (mcp-server-architect, storage-engineer, tools-developer, search-engineer, testing-specialist) to ensure they read critical architecture and design documents before and after coding tasks.

The change addresses a gap in the development workflow where coding agents could implement solutions without full awareness of architectural constraints, system design requirements, or integration specifications, leading to potential conflicts and rework.

Project-coordinator validated this as a high-value improvement that aligns with documentation-driven development best practices and should be implemented immediately to prevent future issues.

## **Impact Assessment**

### **Timeline Impact**
- **Delay Added**: No impact - improves long-term velocity
- **Remaining Buffer**: 10 hours available in timeline (unchanged)
- **Critical Path Impact**: No - this is a process improvement that prevents delays

### **Scope Impact**
- **Features Added**: None - process improvement only
- **Features Removed**: None
- **Features Modified**: None - implementation approach enhanced
- **Scope Boundary Changes**: None - stays within established scope

### **Quality Impact**
- **Documentation Quality**: Enhanced - ensures architectural consistency
- **Process Quality**: Enhanced - systematic architecture review workflow
- **Technical Quality**: Enhanced - prevents architectural conflicts and integration issues
- **Risk Level**: Reduced - proactive prevention of costly architectural rework

### **Resource Impact**
- **Additional Development Time**: 5-10 minutes per coding task (saves hours of potential rework)
- **New Dependencies**: None - uses existing documentation
- **Team Impact**: Improved workflow efficiency and reduced technical debt

---

## **Dependencies**

### **Dependent On** (This change requires):
- Existing TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md document (available)
- Existing SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md document (available)
- Existing DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md document (available)

### **Blocks** (This change blocks):
- None - this is an enhancement to existing workflow

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
Coding subagents were only required to read DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md before starting work, with no systematic architecture review requirements. This could lead to implementation approaches that conflict with architectural constraints or integration requirements.

### **Post-Change State**
All coding subagents must now:

**BEFORE Requirements**:
- Read DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md (existing requirement)
- Read TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md (focus on relevant sections)
- Read SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md (focus on architectural constraints)

**AFTER Requirements**:
- Validate implementation against architectural requirements
- Check component integration specifications
- Document any architectural deviations

### **Migration/Transition Steps**
1. Update CLAUDE.md with new "CODING AGENT MANDATORY WORKFLOW" section
2. Add specific BEFORE and AFTER requirements under "Development Specialist Workflow"
3. Update CHANGES_INDEX.md with change record
4. No migration needed for existing work - applies to future development

---

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Validation Criteria**
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with mandatory workflow section
- [x] BEFORE requirements clearly specify required documentation reading
- [x] AFTER requirements specify validation and integration checks
- [x] Change integrated into existing workflow structure
- [x] CHANGES_INDEX.md updated with proper change record

### **Testing Performed**
- Content review - verified new section integrates properly with existing agent workflow
- Format validation - confirmed consistency with existing CLAUDE.md structure
- Documentation cross-reference - verified all referenced documents exist and are accessible
- Change management compliance - followed established change documentation process

### **Rollback Plan**
If issues arise, remove the "CODING AGENT MANDATORY WORKFLOW" section from CLAUDE.md and update CHANGES_INDEX.md to mark this change as rolled back.
