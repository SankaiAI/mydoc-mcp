# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-010  
**File Name**: CHANGE-010-project-coordinator-agent-addition.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Time**: Pre-development phase  
**Type**: Process/Tooling  
**Impact**: Low  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Added project-coordinator agent to bridge the gap between user implementation suggestions and technical best practices for better decision-making during development.

**Rationale**: User identified need for an agent that can mediate between user's implementation ideas and technical complexity, preventing miscommunication and ensuring optimal technical decisions align with user intent and project constraints.

---

## **Detailed Description**

Created a new specialized agent called project-coordinator that serves as a technical decision mediator for the mydocs-mcp project. This agent helps bridge knowledge gaps between user understanding and technical implementation requirements, validates implementation approaches, and prevents miscommunication before development begins.

The project-coordinator agent is specifically designed for the 3-day mydocs-mcp development timeline and includes decision frameworks, conflict resolution processes, and collaboration guidelines with other agents.

Key capabilities:
1. **Technical Decision Mediation**: Evaluates user suggestions against best practices
2. **Implementation Approach Validation**: Ensures proposed solutions align with project scope
3. **Knowledge Gap Bridging**: Translates between user intent and technical complexity
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Provides structured process for resolving technical disagreements
5. **Project Context Awareness**: Maintains focus on 3-day timeline and MVP constraints

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
- No structured approach for handling user/technical decision conflicts
- Potential for implementation misalignment between user intent and technical best practices
- Gap in decision validation process for technical approaches
- No formal mediation process for technical trade-offs

### **Post-Change State**
- Structured project-coordinator agent with specific mydocs-mcp context
- Clear decision framework for evaluating implementation approaches
- Formal conflict resolution process for technical decisions
- Integrated collaboration with project-documentor agent
- Enhanced technical decision documentation and validation

### **Implementation Steps**
1. ✅ Created project-coordinator agent specification file
2. ✅ Integrated agent into CLAUDE.md available agents list
3. ✅ Added usage guidelines to CLAUDE.md
4. ✅ Updated project-documentor with coordination guidelines
5. ✅ Created comprehensive change record

---

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Validation Criteria**
- ✅ Agent specification covers all necessary decision-making scenarios
- ✅ Integration with CLAUDE.md provides clear usage guidelines
- ✅ Coordination with project-documentor is well-defined
- ✅ Decision framework addresses mydocs-mcp specific constraints
- ✅ Agent supports 3-day timeline requirements

### **Testing Performed**
- Created comprehensive agent specification using mydocs-mcp context
- Verified integration with existing agent framework
- Confirmed coordination guidelines with project-documentor agent
- Validated decision framework covers common scenarios
- Tested agent specification against project requirements

### **Rollback Plan**
- Simple: Remove project-coordinator from CLAUDE.md and revert project-documentor changes
- Agent specification file can be deleted if problematic
- No impact on core development functionality
