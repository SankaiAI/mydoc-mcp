# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-013  
**File Name**: CHANGE-013-document-root-path-resolution.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Time**: Day 3 - Post-MVP Enhancement  
**Type**: Feature Enhancement / Technical Architecture  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Status**: PENDING  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Enhance MCP indexDocument tool to support relative path resolution using DOCUMENT_ROOT configuration

**Rationale**: Users expect to be able to reference documents using relative paths (e.g., "index api-guide.md") without specifying full absolute paths, leveraging the configured DOCUMENT_ROOT setting for natural Claude Code interaction.

---

## **Detailed Description**

Currently, the mydocs-mcp system has DOCUMENT_ROOT and DOCUMENT_DIRECTORIES configuration variables, but the indexDocument tool still requires absolute file paths. This creates a disconnect between user expectations and actual functionality.

When users configure their Claude Code with a DOCUMENT_ROOT, they expect to be able to:
- Say "index api-guide.md" instead of "index /full/path/to/api-guide.md"
- Have the MCP tools automatically resolve relative paths against the configured document root
- Use natural language without needing to remember or type full file system paths

This enhancement would align the tool behavior with the configuration system and improve user experience significantly.

---

## **Changes Made**

### **Files to be Modified**:
- src/tools/indexDocument.py - Add relative path resolution logic
- src/config.py - Ensure DOCUMENT_ROOT is properly accessible to tools
- src/tools/base_tool.py - Add path resolution utilities if needed
- tests/test_indexDocument_tool.py - Add tests for relative path handling

### **Files to be Created**:
- docs/examples/RELATIVE_PATH_USAGE.md - Usage examples for relative paths

### **Files Deleted** (if applicable):
- None

---

## **Impact Assessment**

### **Timeline Impact**
- **Delay Added**: 4-6 hours development time
- **Remaining Buffer**: N/A (post-MVP enhancement)
- **Critical Path Impact**: No - this is an enhancement, not core functionality

### **Scope Impact**
- **Features Added**: Relative path resolution for document indexing
- **Features Removed**: None
- **Features Modified**: indexDocument tool behavior enhanced
- **Scope Boundary Changes**: This adds to the OUT OF SCOPE items from MVP, moving toward post-MVP enhancements

### **Quality Impact**
- **Documentation Quality**: Enhanced - clearer usage examples
- **Process Quality**: Enhanced - more intuitive user workflow
- **Technical Quality**: Enhanced - better configuration utilization
- **Risk Level**: Reduced - less user error from incorrect paths

### **Resource Impact**
- **Additional Development Time**: 4-6 hours
- **New Dependencies**: None - uses existing configuration system
- **Team Impact**: None - backward compatible change

---

## **Dependencies**

### **Dependent On** (This change requires):
- Existing DOCUMENT_ROOT configuration system
- Current indexDocument tool functionality

### **Blocks** (This change blocks):
- None - this is an enhancement

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
Users must provide absolute paths when asking Claude Code to index documents:
- "Index the document at /home/user/documents/api-guide.md"
- Full path specification required for every file operation

### **Post-Change State**
Users can provide relative paths that resolve against DOCUMENT_ROOT:
- "Index api-guide.md" -> resolves to DOCUMENT_ROOT + "/api-guide.md"
- "Index docs/guides/setup.md" -> resolves to DOCUMENT_ROOT + "/docs/guides/setup.md"
- Absolute paths still work for backward compatibility

### **Migration/Transition Steps** (if applicable)
1. No migration needed - change is backward compatible
2. Update documentation with new usage examples
3. Update Claude Code configuration examples

---

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Validation Criteria**
- [ ] Relative paths resolve correctly against DOCUMENT_ROOT
- [ ] Absolute paths continue to work (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Proper error handling for files not found in DOCUMENT_ROOT
- [ ] Configuration precedence handled correctly
- [ ] Natural language interaction works with Claude Code

### **Testing Performed**
- [To be completed during implementation]

### **Rollback Plan** (if applicable)
Simple: revert changes to indexDocument.py - tool falls back to absolute path requirement

---

## **Approval Process**

### **Approval Required From**:
- [ ] **Project Sponsor** - Required for: Feature addition beyond MVP scope
- [ ] **Technical Lead** - Required for: Tool architecture changes  
- [ ] **Quality Assurance** - Optional
- [ ] **No approval needed** - [Not applicable]

### **Approval Status**
- **Requested Date**: 2025-09-05
- **Approved Date**: [Pending]
- **Approved By**: [Pending]
- **Approval Comments**: [Pending review]

## **Communication**

### **Stakeholders Notified**:
- User - 2025-09-05 - Requested feature during cleanup session
- Development Team - 2025-09-05 - Change documented

### **Documentation Updates Required**:
- [ ] README.md - Update Claude Code configuration examples with relative path usage
- [ ] docs/CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md - Add relative path examples and troubleshooting
- [ ] docs/API_REFERENCE.md - Update indexDocument tool parameters and examples
- [ ] docs/TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md - Document path resolution logic and flow
- [ ] src/tools/indexDocument.py - Update docstrings and parameter descriptions
- [ ] User guides - Add natural language usage examples for Claude Code interaction

---

## **Lessons Learned**

### **What Went Well**:
- User feedback identified important usability gap
- Existing configuration system provides foundation for enhancement
- Clear user expectation vs. reality mismatch identified

### **What Could Be Improved**:
- Should have implemented relative path support in initial MVP
- Configuration system should have been more tightly integrated with tools from start

### **Recommendations for Future**:
- Consider user workflow and natural language expectations during initial design
- Integrate configuration variables fully with tool implementations
- Test with actual Claude Code usage scenarios earlier
