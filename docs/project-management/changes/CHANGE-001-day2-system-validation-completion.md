- `scripts/performance_validation.py` - Created performance testing script
- `scripts/integration_test.py` - Created integration testing script
- `docs/project-management/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md` - Updated Task 8.2 as complete

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 3 Phase 1)
1. Execute Task 8.1: Claude Code Integration Test
2. Begin Documentation Package creation (Task 9.1-9.4)
3. Prepare demo environment and sample documents

### Day 3 Focus Areas
1. **Priority 1**: Demo preparation and Claude Code integration validation
2. **Priority 2**: Documentation package (README, API reference, deployment guide)
3. **Priority 3**: Final system testing and performance validation
4. **Priority 4**: Troubleshooting guide and user documentation
