# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-011  
**File Name**: CHANGE-011-development-status-workflow-integration.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Time**: Pre-development phase  
**Type**: Process/Tooling  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Integrated DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md into project workflow with comprehensive documentation update rules and workflow decision matrix for Claude Code session continuity.

**Rationale**: User identified need for Claude Code to know which documents to update when during different project phases, and to ensure DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md is properly maintained for session continuity throughout the 3-day sprint.

---

## **Detailed Description**

Enhanced the project management workflow to include comprehensive rules for when, how, and which documents Claude Code should update during development. This ensures proper maintenance of the DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md file and establishes clear protocols for document updates based on different development activities.

Key enhancements include:
1. **Mandatory DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md workflow** - Rules for real-time progress tracking
2. **Document classification system** - Immutable, real-time, regular, and milestone update categories
3. **Update frequency guidelines** - When to update which documents
4. **Workflow decision matrix** - Clear decision tree for document updates
5. **Session continuity protocols** - Start/end session requirements

This ensures that any Claude Code session can maintain proper documentation throughout development and provides seamless handoffs between sessions.

---

## **Dependencies**

### **Dependent On** (This change requires):
- DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md (existing - CHANGE-010 related)
- CLAUDE.md framework (existing)
- PROJECT_SCHEDULE_3DAY.md (existing)

### **Blocks** (This change blocks):
- None - enables better development workflow

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
- No clear rules for when to update which documents
- Risk of inconsistent documentation during development
- Potential for lost progress between Claude Code sessions
- Unclear protocols for DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md maintenance

### **Post-Change State**
- Comprehensive workflow rules in CLAUDE.md
- Clear document classification and update protocols
- Mandatory DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md tracking workflow
- Workflow decision matrix for all development scenarios
- Session continuity protocols established

### **Key Workflow Rules Implemented**:

1. **Session Start Protocol**:
   - MUST read DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md first
   - Update current context with session start
   - Get immediate next actions

2. **Task Completion Protocol**:
   - MANDATORY: Update DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md immediately
   - Change status to ‚úÖ COMPLETE
   - Add timestamp and notes
   - Update progress metrics

3. **Session End Protocol**:
   - CRITICAL: Update "Session Handoff Notes"
   - Document current state and next priority
   - Update any blockers for next session

4. **Development Activity Matrix**:
   - Clear rules for 9 different development activities
   - Specific requirements for each document type
   - Conditional vs. mandatory update guidelines
