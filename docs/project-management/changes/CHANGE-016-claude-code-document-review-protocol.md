# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-016  
**File Name**: CHANGE-016-claude-code-document-review-protocol.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Time**: Pre-development (Day 1 preparation)  
**Type**: Critical Process Enhancement + Governance  
**Impact**: High  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Add mandatory document review protocol for Claude Code itself before each development task, ensuring governance consistency with subagent requirements.

**Rationale**: project-coordinator analysis identified critical process compliance gap where Claude Code wasn't following same document review standards required for subagents, risking architecture drift and performance target violations.

---

## **Detailed Description**

This change addresses a critical gap in process compliance where Claude Code was requiring subagents to follow mandatory document review protocols (reading DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md, TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md, SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md, etc.) but was not following the same standards itself. The project-coordinator analysis revealed this creates risk for:

1. **Architecture Drift**: Claude Code making development decisions without referencing architectural constraints
2. **Performance Target Violations**: Missing sub-200ms requirements during implementation
3. **Scope Compliance Issues**: Not checking current context and priorities before starting work
4. **Integration Conflicts**: Making changes without understanding component interaction specifications

The solution implements a mandatory Light Protocol (15-30 seconds per task) that requires Claude Code to quickly review key documents before each development task, maintaining the same governance standards it requires from subagents.

- **Remaining Buffer**: 10 hours available in timeline (unchanged)
- **Critical Path Impact**: No - prevents critical path delays through early issue detection

### **Scope Impact**
- **Features Added**: Document review protocol for Claude Code compliance
- **Features Removed**: None
- **Features Modified**: Enhanced governance consistency across all agents
- **Scope Boundary Changes**: None - process improvement within existing governance framework

### **Quality Impact**

- **Process Quality**: Significantly Enhanced - prevents architectural conflicts and rework cycles
- **Technical Quality**: Enhanced - ensures performance targets and design requirements are maintained
- **Risk Level**: Significantly Reduced - prevents hours of rework and integration issues

### **Resource Impact**
- **Additional Development Time**: +15-30 seconds per task (minimal)
- **New Dependencies**: None
- **Team Impact**: Improved consistency and reduced rework requirements

---

## **Dependencies**

### **Dependent On** (This change requires):
- **Existing architectural documents** - TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md, SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md
- **Current project management framework** - DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md, PROJECT_SCOPE_3DAY.md
- **project-coordinator analysis** - Analysis that identified this compliance gap

### **Blocks** (This change blocks):
- **Future architectural drift** - Prevents architectural inconsistencies
- **Performance target violations** - Ensures requirements are checked before implementation
- **Integration conflicts** - Prevents component interface mismatches

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
Claude Code required subagents to follow mandatory document review protocols (reading key architectural and status documents before starting work) but did not follow the same protocols itself. This created:
- Risk of architectural decisions without full context
- Potential for performance requirement violations
- Inconsistent governance standards between Claude Code and subagents
- Missing integration constraint awareness during development

### **Post-Change State**
Claude Code now follows the same mandatory document review protocol it requires from subagents:
- Quick scan of DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md for current context and priorities
- Reference TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md for technical approach and constraints
- Check PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md when modifying or adding files
- Review SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md for design decisions and performance targets
- Compliance checklist for pre-task validation
- Enforcement language making this mandatory for all future tasks

### **Migration/Transition Steps**
1. Updated CLAUDE.md with new mandatory protocol section
2. Added comprehensive compliance requirements and checklist
3. Included enforcement language for mandatory compliance
4. Updated change management documentation
5. Protocol takes effect immediately for all future development tasks

---

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Validation Criteria**
- [x] **Protocol Integration Complete** - New section added to CLAUDE.md with comprehensive requirements
- [x] **Compliance Checklist Created** - Clear checklist for pre-task validation
- [x] **Enforcement Language Added** - Mandatory compliance language included
- [x] **Change Documentation Complete** - Full change record created and indexed

### **Testing Performed**
- **Document Integration Test** - Verified new protocol section integrates properly with existing CLAUDE.md structure
- **Compliance Verification** - Confirmed all required document types are included in review protocol
- **Enforcement Validation** - Verified mandatory compliance language is clear and actionable

### **Rollback Plan**
If issues arise, remove the new protocol section from CLAUDE.md and revert to previous governance structure. However, this is not recommended as it would restore the compliance gap.
