# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-014  
**File Name**: CHANGE-014-management-strategy-documentation-standardization.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Time**: Post-MVP Enhancement Phase  
**Type**: Process/Governance + Strategic + Documentation  
**Impact**: High  
**Status**: APPROVED (Strategic Management Decision)  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Transition mydocs-mcp from pure project management approach to hybrid Product/Project Management approach with industry-standard documentation naming and structure.

**Rationale**: Research indicates mydocs-mcp should follow PRODUCT MANAGEMENT for strategic vision and roadmap planning, while using PROJECT MANAGEMENT for tactical feature implementation. Current documentation uses custom naming that doesn't align with industry standards (PMBOK, Product Management best practices).

---

## **Detailed Description**

Post-MVP analysis reveals that mydocs-mcp has characteristics of both a product (ongoing evolution, user feedback integration, feature roadmap) and projects (discrete implementation sprints, deliverable-focused phases). Industry best practices recommend a hybrid approach:

**PRODUCT MANAGEMENT LEVEL (Strategic):**
- Long-term vision and roadmap planning
- User need prioritization and feature backlog management  
- Market positioning and competitive analysis
- Success metrics and user experience optimization

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT LEVEL (Tactical):**
- Sprint planning and execution
- Resource allocation and timeline management
- Deliverable tracking and quality assurance
- Change control and risk management

Current documentation uses custom names that don't align with established industry terminology, making it difficult for stakeholders familiar with standard practices to navigate and understand the project structure.

## **Changes Made**

### **Files to be Renamed (Industry Standardization)**:

**PRODUCT MANAGEMENT LEVEL:**
- PersonalDocAgent_MCP_PRD.md → Product_Requirements_Document.md (aligns with Product Management standards)
- [NEW] Product_Roadmap.md (feature prioritization over time)
- [NEW] Product_Backlog.md (prioritized enhancement list) 
- [NEW] User_Journey_Map.md (Claude Code user experience)

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT LEVEL:**
- PROJECT_SCOPE_3DAY.md → Project_Charter.md (aligns with PMBOK standards)
- PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md → Work_Breakdown_Structure.md (standard PMBOK terminology)
- DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md → Project_Status_Report.md (standard project reporting)
- CHANGES_INDEX.md → Change_Control_Log.md (standard change management terminology)

**TECHNICAL DOCUMENTS:**
- TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md → Technical_Design_Document.md (industry standard)
- SYSTEM_DESIGN_REQUIREMENTS.md → System_Requirements_Specification.md (IEEE standard)
- API_REFERENCE.md → Technical_Specification.md (consolidated technical reference)

### **Files Created**:
- Product_Roadmap.md - Strategic feature planning and timeline
- Product_Backlog.md - Prioritized list of enhancements and features
- User_Journey_Map.md - End-to-end user experience documentation
- Management_Strategy_Framework.md - Documentation of hybrid approach

### **Files Modified**:
- CLAUDE.md - Update all file references and protocols for new naming convention
- All cross-references throughout documentation system
- Directory structure optimization for new hierarchy

## **Impact Assessment**

### **Timeline Impact**
- **Delay Added**: No impact on development - documentation organization only
- **Remaining Buffer**: N/A (post-MVP enhancement)
- **Critical Path Impact**: No - improves project management efficiency

### **Scope Impact**
- **Features Added**: None - documentation restructure only
- **Features Removed**: None
- **Features Modified**: Management processes improved
- **Scope Boundary Changes**: None - maintains existing boundaries

### **Quality Impact**
- **Documentation Quality**: Enhanced significantly - industry standard alignment
- **Process Quality**: Enhanced - clear separation of strategic vs tactical activities  
- **Technical Quality**: No change - technical implementation unchanged
- **Risk Level**: Reduced - clearer governance and decision-making processes

### **Resource Impact**
- **Additional Development Time**: 4-6 hours for documentation restructure
- **New Dependencies**: None - uses existing documentation tools
- **Team Impact**: Improved clarity for stakeholders familiar with industry standards

---

## **Dependencies**

### **Dependent On** (This change requires):
- Completion of MVP development phase 
- Analysis of Product vs Project Management approaches
- Stakeholder approval for management strategy shift

### **Blocks** (This change blocks):
- Future product roadmap planning (waiting for Product_Roadmap.md structure)
- Standardized status reporting (waiting for Project_Status_Report.md format)

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
- Custom documentation naming convention
- Pure project management approach throughout
- Mixed strategic and tactical documentation without clear hierarchy
- Non-standard terminology potentially confusing to industry stakeholders

### **Post-Change State**
- Industry-standard document naming aligned with PMBOK and Product Management practices
- Clear separation of Product (strategic) vs Project (tactical) concerns
- Professional documentation hierarchy recognizable to industry stakeholders
- Hybrid management approach optimized for both product evolution and project execution

### **Migration/Transition Steps**
1. Create CHANGE-014 documentation and get approval
2. Create new Product Management documents (Roadmap, Backlog, User Journey)
3. Rename existing files following industry standards
4. Update all cross-references and links throughout documentation
5. Update CLAUDE.md with new file names and revised protocols
6. Verify all links and references work correctly
7. Update change management system to new naming convention
8. Document hybrid management process framework

---

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Validation Criteria**
- [x] All file renames completed without broken links
- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with correct file references
- [x] Change management system reflects new naming convention
- [x] Product Management documents created with appropriate content
- [x] Clear documentation of hybrid management approach
- [x] All cross-references updated and verified
- [x] Documentation hierarchy logically organized

### **Testing Performed**
- Link validation across all renamed files
- CLAUDE.md protocol verification 
- Cross-reference accuracy check
- Document accessibility and navigation testing

### **Rollback Plan**
If issues arise, revert file names to original convention and restore CLAUDE.md to previous state. All content remains intact, only naming changes.
