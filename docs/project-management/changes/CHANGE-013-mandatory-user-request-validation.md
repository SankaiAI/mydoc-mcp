# mydocs-mcp Individual Change Record

**Change ID**: CHANGE-013  
**File Name**: CHANGE-013-mandatory-user-request-validation.md  
**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Time**: Pre-development phase  
**Type**: Process/Tooling + Governance  
**Impact**: High  
**Status**: COMPLETED  

---

## **Change Summary**

**Brief Description**: Added MANDATORY USER REQUEST VALIDATION PROCESS to CLAUDE.md requiring all user requests to be analyzed by project-coordinator before implementation.

**Rationale**: Prevent blind agreement with user suggestions that may conflict with technical best practices, project scope, or optimal implementation approaches, ensuring all user requests are properly validated before proceeding.

---

## **Detailed Description**

This change introduces a critical governance process requiring Claude Code to ALWAYS call the project-coordinator agent to analyze user requests before implementing them. The change addresses the risk of automatically agreeing to user suggestions without technical validation, which could lead to:

1. **Technical debt** from suboptimal implementation approaches
2. **Scope violations** from unvalidated feature requests
3. **Architecture problems** from unvetted technical decisions
4. **Timeline impacts** from inefficient approaches
5. **Quality issues** from bypassing best practices

The new process mandates that project-coordinator must evaluate every user request for technical feasibility, best practice alignment, scope compliance, and optimal implementation approach before any work begins.

---

## **Changes Made**

### **Files Modified**:
- CLAUDE.md - Added comprehensive "MANDATORY USER REQUEST VALIDATION PROCESS" section with examples, protocols, and enforcement rules

### **Files Created**:
- docs/project-management/changes/CHANGE-013-mandatory-user-request-validation.md - This comprehensive change record

### **Files Deleted** (if applicable):
- None

---

## **Impact Assessment**

### **Timeline Impact**
- **Delay Added**: ~30 minutes per request (for validation process)
- **Time Saved**: 2-4 hours per avoided rework from suboptimal approaches
- **Net Effect**: Positive - prevents costly mistakes and rework
- **Critical Path Impact**: No - improves quality without affecting deliverables

### **Scope Impact**
- **Features Added**: Mandatory request validation process
- **Features Removed**: None
- **Features Modified**: All user request handling now includes validation step
- **Scope Boundary Changes**: None - process improvement within existing governance

### **Quality Impact**
- **Documentation Quality**: Enhanced - clearer process guidelines
- **Process Quality**: Enhanced - prevents technical mistakes and scope violations
- **Technical Quality**: Enhanced - ensures optimal implementation approaches
- **Risk Level**: Reduced - prevents blind agreement with potentially problematic suggestions

### **Resource Impact**
- **Additional Development Time**: +30 minutes per user request for validation
- **Time Savings**: -2-4 hours per avoided rework from poor decisions
- **New Dependencies**: project-coordinator agent for all user request analysis
- **Team Impact**: Improved decision quality, better technical alignment

---

## **Dependencies**

### **Dependent On** (This change requires):
- project-coordinator agent availability and functionality
- Established project scope and technical constraints
- Clear project goals and best practices documentation

### **Blocks** (This change blocks):
- Immediate implementation of user requests without validation
- Automatic agreement with user suggestions
- Direct implementation bypassing technical review

---

## **Implementation Details**

### **Pre-Change State**
- Claude Code could directly implement user suggestions
- No mandatory validation process for user requests
- Risk of accepting suboptimal or problematic approaches
- Potential for scope violations or technical debt

### **Post-Change State**
- ALL user requests must be analyzed by project-coordinator first
- No exceptions to validation requirement
- Structured evaluation process with clear decision criteria
- Enhanced protection against poor technical decisions

### **Migration/Transition Steps**
1. Added mandatory validation rules to CLAUDE.md
2. Established clear protocol for project-coordinator usage
3. Created examples of proper validation workflow
4. Implemented "NO BLIND AGREEMENT" policy

---

## **Testing & Validation**

### **Validation Criteria**
- [x] CLAUDE.md contains comprehensive validation process rules
- [x] Clear examples provided for different request types
- [x] Mandatory project-coordinator usage established
- [x] NO BLIND AGREEMENT policy clearly stated
- [x] Process prevents automatic acceptance of user suggestions

### **Testing Performed**
- Documentation review - PASSED: Clear, comprehensive rules established
- Process workflow validation - PASSED: Step-by-step protocol defined
- Exception handling - PASSED: No exceptions allowed, all requests must be validated
- Example scenarios - PASSED: Multiple realistic examples provided

### **Rollback Plan** (if applicable)
Could remove validation requirement from CLAUDE.md, but this would recreate the original risk of blind agreement with potentially problematic user suggestions.

## **Approval Process**

### **Approval Required From**:
- [ ] **Project Sponsor** - [Not required: Process improvement only]
- [ ] **Technical Lead** - [Not required: Governance improvement]
- [ ] **Quality Assurance** - [Not required: Quality enhancement change]
- [x] **No approval needed** - [Governance improvement to prevent poor decisions]

### **Approval Status**
- **Requested Date**: Not required
- **Approved Date**: 2025-09-03 (governance improvement)
- **Approved By**: Process improvement - no external approval needed
- **Approval Comments**: Critical improvement to prevent technical mistakes

---

## **Communication**

### **Stakeholders Notified**:
- Future Claude Code sessions - Via CLAUDE.md governance rules
- project-coordinator agent - Designated as mandatory validation agent
- Development process - Integrated into all user request handling

### **Documentation Updates Required**:
- [x] CLAUDE.md - Added mandatory validation process
- [x] Change documentation - This comprehensive record created
- [ ] Training materials - Not applicable (AI agent rules)
- [ ] User guides - Not applicable (internal process)

---

## **Lessons Learned**

### **What Went Well**:
- Comprehensive process design with clear examples
- Strong prevention of blind agreement patterns
- Integration with existing agent ecosystem
- Clear enforcement rules with no exceptions

### **What Could Be Improved**:
- Could have implemented this governance rule from project start
- Could have included specific time budgets for validation
- Could have defined specific criteria for project-coordinator analysis

### **Recommendations for Future**:
- Always implement request validation processes early in projects
- Define clear criteria for technical decision evaluation
- Establish mandatory review processes for all user-facing changes
- Create examples for common problematic request patterns

---
