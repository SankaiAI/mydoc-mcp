### 4. **src/watcher/__init__.py** - Module Interface
- **Public API**: Clean interface for watcher components
- **Convenience Functions**: Factory functions for common configurations
- **Configuration Presets**: Lightweight and batch-optimized presets

### 5. **MCP Server Integration** - Server Lifecycle Management  
- **Server Startup**: Automatic watcher initialization with server start
- **Server Shutdown**: Graceful watcher cleanup on server stop
- **Status Monitoring**: Server methods for watcher health and statistics
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for watcher failures

## 🔧 Technical Features

## 🚀 Integration Points

### MCP Server Integration
```python
# Automatic watcher initialization in server startup
async def start_stdio_server(self):
    await self._initialize_tools()
    await self._initialize_watcher()  # Watcher starts with server
    # Server runs...

async def stop(self):
    if self.file_watcher:
        await self.file_watcher.stop()  # Graceful shutdown
```

### IndexDocument Tool Integration
```python
# Seamless integration with existing indexDocument tool
async def _handle_file_created(self, file_event):
    result = await self._index_document(file_event.file_path)
    return 'indexed' if result else 'skipped'
```

### Database Integration
```python
# Smart database operations for file lifecycle events
async def _handle_file_moved(self, file_event):
    # Update database path on file moves
    result = await self.database_manager.doc_queries.update_document_path(
        existing_doc.id, file_event.file_path
    )
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics
