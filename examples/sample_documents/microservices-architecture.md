# Microservices Architecture Guide

## Introduction

Microservices architecture is a design approach where applications are built as a collection of small, autonomous services that communicate through well-defined APIs.

## Key Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each microservice should focus on one business capability and do it well.

### 2. Autonomous Teams
Teams can develop, deploy, and scale their services independently.

### 3. Decentralized
- Decentralized data management
- Decentralized governance
- Technology diversity allowed

## Architecture Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern
- Single entry point for clients
- Request routing and aggregation
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth, rate limiting)

### Service Discovery
- Dynamic service registration
- Health checking
- Load balancing

### Circuit Breaker
- Prevent cascading failures
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic recovery

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- REST APIs
- GraphQL
- gRPC

### Asynchronous Communication
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS)
- Event streaming (Kafka, AWS Kinesis)
- Pub/Sub patterns

## Data Management

### Database per Service
- Each service owns its data
- No direct database access between services
- Data consistency through events

### Saga Pattern
- Distributed transactions
- Compensating transactions
- Event choreography vs orchestration

## Deployment Strategies

### Containerization
```dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Kubernetes Orchestration
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: user-service:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

## Service Mesh

### Istio Features
- Traffic management
- Security (mTLS)
- Observability
- Policy enforcement

## Monitoring and Observability

### Distributed Tracing
- Correlation IDs
- Trace aggregation (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Performance analysis

### Logging
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Structured logging
- Log aggregation

### Metrics
- Application metrics (Prometheus)
- Business metrics
- SLA monitoring

## Security

### Zero Trust Architecture
- Service-to-service authentication
- Mutual TLS (mTLS)
- API key management

### Secrets Management
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Kubernetes Secrets

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Test individual services
- Mock external dependencies
- High code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test service interactions
- Contract testing (Pact)
- API testing

### End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user flows
- Production-like environment
- Automated test suites

## Common Challenges

### Distributed System Complexity
- Network latency
- Partial failures
- Data consistency

### Operational Overhead
- Multiple deployments
- Service versioning
- Dependency management

### Debugging
- Distributed logs
- Complex failure scenarios
- Performance bottlenecks

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a monolith** - Extract services gradually
2. **Design for failure** - Assume services will fail
3. **Automate everything** - CI/CD pipelines essential
4. **Monitor extensively** - You can't fix what you can't see
5. **Document APIs** - Clear contracts between services
6. **Version carefully** - Backward compatibility matters
7. **Secure by default** - Zero trust approach

## Tools and Technologies

### Development
- Spring Boot (Java)
- Express.js (Node.js)
- FastAPI (Python)
- Go Kit (Go)

### Infrastructure
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Ansible

### Monitoring
- Prometheus + Grafana
- ELK Stack
- Datadog
- New Relic
