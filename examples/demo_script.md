# mydocs-mcp Demo Script

## Demo Setup

### Prerequisites
1. mydocs-mcp server installed and running
2. Claude Code configured with MCP server
3. Sample documents indexed

### Start the Server
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the MCP server
cd /path/to/mydocs-mcp
python -m src.main

# You should see:
# Starting mydocs-mcp server with stdio transport...
# Log level: INFO
```

### Verify Claude Code Integration
In Claude Code settings, ensure MCP server is configured:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mydocs": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/mydocs-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Index Documents (2 minutes)

**User to Claude Code:**
```
"Index all the markdown files in the examples/sample_documents folder"
```

**Expected Claude Code Actions:**
1. Calls `indexDocument` for each .md file
2. Shows success confirmation with document IDs
3. Reports indexing performance metrics

**Verify:**
```
"How many documents have been indexed?"
```

---

### Scenario 2: Search Documents (3 minutes)

**Simple Search:**
```
"Search for documents about API design"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Returns `api-design-guide.md` with high relevance score
- Shows snippet with highlighted keywords
- Displays search time < 200ms

**Advanced Search:**
```
"Find all documents that mention authentication or security"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Multiple documents returned
- Relevance scores shown
- Results ranked by relevance

**Filter by Type:**
```
"Search for markdown files about testing"
```

---

### Scenario 3: Retrieve Documents (2 minutes)

**Get Specific Document:**
```
"Show me the API design guide"
```

**Expected Claude Code Actions:**
1. Searches for "API design guide"
2. Retrieves the best match
3. Displays full content

**Get by Path:**
```
"Get the document at examples/sample_documents/microservices-architecture.md"
```

---

### Scenario 4: Real-World Use Case (5 minutes)

**User Story:** "I need to create a new API specification document similar to ones I've written before"

**Step 1: Find Similar Documents**
```
"Search for all my API documentation and specification files"
```

**Step 2: Analyze Patterns**
```
"Show me the structure of the API design guide"
```

**Step 3: Create New Document**
```
"Based on the API design guide, create a template for a new Payment API specification"
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Claude Code uses retrieved documents as reference
- Creates new document following identified patterns
- Maintains consistent style and structure

---

### Scenario 5: Performance Demonstration (2 minutes)

**Bulk Operations:**
```
"Index 10 documents and show me the performance metrics"
```

**Expected Metrics:**
- Each document indexed in < 200ms
- Total operation time displayed
- Database write confirmation

**Search Performance:**
```
"Search for 'microservices' and show me the search time"
```

**Expected:**
- Search completes in < 100ms
- Performance metrics included in response

---

## Demo Talking Points

### Key Features to Highlight

1. **Sub-200ms Performance**
   - "Notice how all operations complete in under 200ms"
   - "This ensures responsive interaction with Claude Code"

2. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
   - "Using standard MCP tools that any MCP client can use"
   - "Clean JSON-RPC communication over stdio"

3. **Intelligent Search**
   - "Relevance ranking ensures best results first"
   - "Keyword highlighting helps identify matches"

4. **Auto-Indexing**
   - "File watcher automatically indexes new documents"
   - "No manual reindexing needed"

5. **Metadata Extraction**
   - "Automatically extracts titles, word counts, and structure"
   - "Helps with search relevance and filtering"

### Common Questions and Answers

**Q: What file types are supported?**
A: Currently .md and .txt files. PDF and DOCX coming in Phase 2.

**Q: How many documents can it handle?**
A: Tested with 10,000+ documents maintaining sub-200ms performance.

**Q: Does it work with remote documents?**
A: Currently local-only via stdio. HTTP+SSE transport coming in Phase 4.

**Q: Can multiple users access it?**
A: Single-user in MVP. Multi-user support planned for enterprise version.

**Q: Is the search semantic or keyword-based?**
A: Keyword-based with TF-IDF ranking in MVP. Semantic search coming in Phase 2.

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### If Search Returns No Results
```bash
# Check if documents are indexed
python tests/test_integration.py

# Force reindex if needed
python -m src.tools.reindex --force
```

### If Server Doesn't Start
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Must be 3.11+

# Verify dependencies
pip list | grep mcp

# Check for port conflicts (if using HTTP mode)
netstat -an | grep 3000
```

### If Claude Code Can't Connect
1. Verify MCP server is running
2. Check Claude Code MCP settings
3. Restart Claude Code
4. Check logs: `tail -f logs/mydocs-mcp.log`
